				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				<p>Popcorn Time! is the result of many developers and designers putting a bunch of APIs together to make the experience of watching torrent movies as simple as possible.</p>
				<p>We are an open source project. We are from all over the world. We love our movies. And boy, do we love popcorn.</p>	
			</article>

			<article id="legal">
				<h2>Is this legal?</h2>
				<p>Depends on where you're from, really. Once again: we're using torrents, so if you really care, you'd better google what the legal situation around these protocol is where you live.</p>
			</article>

			<article id="seeding">
				<h2>Popcorn Time works using torrents, fair enough. Am I seeding while watching a movie?</h2>
				<p>Indeed, you are. You're going to be uploading bits and bits of the movie for as long as you're watching it on Popcorn Time.</p>
			</article>

			<article id="storage">
				<h2>What happens to the movies after I'm done?</h2>
				<p>Your movies will stay buried in a secret folder somewhere in your drive until you restart your computer. Then it will be gone for good.</p>
			</article>
            <article id="Download Integrity">
				<h2>How can I be sure the download is unmodified and safe?</h2>
				<p>For your additional security we offer optional checksumming of our downloads by listing SHA1 and SHA256 checksums underneath the download links. If the checksum you produce matches the checksum on our site underneath your respective download then you have a safe, unmodified download from our server. If you want to know more about how checksums work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">this</a> Wikipedia article explains their function.</p>

            <article id="How do I checksum?">
				<h2>How can I verify the checksums?</h2>
                <li>On Windows we recommend using <a href="http://www.bitser.org/checksum-calculator-windows-7-freeware.shtml">Bitser</a>, an easy-to-use tool that can verify both SHA1 and SHA256.</li>
                <li>On OS X you can natively check SHA1 checksums by opening up your Terminal application and executing <em>"SHASUM"</em> and then the location of the download you wish to check, such as <em> "SHASUM ~/Downloads/Popcorn-Time-0.3.2-Mac.dmg"</em>. If you prefer to check the SHA256 you can download the excellent <a href="https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep">Hashdeep</a> package through <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> with <em>"brew install hashdeep"</em>.</li>
                <li>On Linux it is usually a case of simply opening your Terminal application and executing <em>"SHA1SUM"</em> or <em>"SHA256SUM"</em> followed by your download location, such as <em>"SHA256SUM /home/username/downloads/Popcorn-Time-0.3.2-Linux-32.tar.gz"</em>.</li>

			<article id="update">
				<h2>Will there be a new version?</h2>
				<p>Most definitely. You're going to have to download it manually though. But fear not! If you're on Beta version 2 or above, you'll be notified within the app. Other than that, we'll let you know through Facebook and/or Twitter.</p>
			</article>

			<article id="movies">
				<h2>How come you've got the latest movies?</h2>
				<p>We search for movies uploaded by YTS. Better ask them how they are handling this!</p>
			</article>

			<article id="episodes">
				<h2>Why are some episodes missing?</h2>
				<p>We grab the TV Show episodes from EZTV. Due to video and audio codec limitations we are very selective on what releases we grab via the API. This is why some TV shows appear to be missing episodes.</p>
			</article>

			<article id="languages">
				<h2>Will you be adding movies in my language?</h2>
				<p>Chances are that most (if not all) of the movies available in Popcorn Time will be in English. However, languages for subtitles and the app itself are constantly being added by our lovely contributors.</p>

				<h2>I can't get past the initial "Please wait..." screen :(</h2>
				<p>Living on Queen Elizabeth's realm, aren't you? Nothing we can do about that right now, sorry. But setting up a proxy might do the trick!</p>
			</article>

			<article id="select-subtitles">
				<h2>Why can't I select subtitles?</h2>
				<p>You may have to wait until all of the movie data (cover, summary, length, etc...) is retrieved. Sometimes it may be something else!</p>
			</article>

			<article id="new-apps">
				<h2>Thinking about launching for Android/iOS/Chromecast/Smart TVs/Commodore 64?</h2>
				<p>Our efforts are currently towards making the best desktop app for watching torrent movies. So launching versions for other devices is not in our inmediate roadmap.</p>
